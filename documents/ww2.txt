World War II, also known as the Second World War, was a global military conflict that took place between September 1, 1939, and September 2, 1945. The war involved major theaters across various regions, including Europe, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian Ocean, South-East Asia, China, Japan, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Horn of Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, and North and South America.

The war saw the formation of two major military alliances: the Allies, which included the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, China, and others, and the Axis, consisting of Germany, Japan, Italy, and others. The conflict resulted in over 60 million deaths, with the majority of casualties being civilians, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.

The Allies achieved victory in the war, leading to the fall of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan. Following the war, Allied military occupations took place in Germany, Japan, Austria, and Korea. Notable outcomes of World War II include the beginning of the Nuclear Age, the dissolution of the League of Nations, and the creation of the United Nations. Additionally, the war facilitated the decolonization of Asia and Africa, leading to the decline of colonial empires.
World War II is renowned for introducing modern warfare and tactics such as air warfare, strategic bombing, blitzkrieg, and the first and only use of nuclear weapons in warfare. It is also remembered for numerous war crimes committed by both Axis and Allied forces, leading to the death of tens of millions of civilians through genocides, massacres, and starvation.

The aftermath of World War II saw the rise of two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, and the onset of the Cold War, characterized by espionage, political subversion, and proxy wars. Europe was divided into the US-led Western Bloc and the USSR-led Eastern Bloc, leading to significant geopolitical tensions.
Overall, World War II had far-reaching consequences, shaping the course of history and laying the foundation for the modern world order.
